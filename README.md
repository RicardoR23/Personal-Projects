<h1>Polynomial Calculator</h1>

Project consists of 2 classes, the Polynomial class which handles the polynomial objects and the methods that can alter them, and the PolynomialCalc class which acts as a frontend and provides the functionality of the calculator to the user. The calculators current functions are: Creating empty polynomials, adding to current polynomials, removing from current polynomials, adding 2 polynomials, and subtracting 2 polynomials.
